# Performance Report

## Usage
```
    [--perf-template={def [default], csv, CUSTOM_TEMPLATE}]
```

where:
 - def -- default template. Has problem name, problem dump, ops (if applied),
          minimum and average time and GFLOPS (if applied)
 - csv -- comma-separated values style template. Same as default, but dumps
          problem and descriptor values with comma delimiter.
 - CUSTOM_TEMPLATE -- user-defined template. Should consist of special options
                      supported by specific driver. Refer to the list of
                      options supported below.


**benchdnn** supports both out-of-the-box and custom performance reports.
A custom template should be passed via the command line and consists of terminal
and nonterminal symbols.
Nonterminal symbols are printed as-is.
Descriptions of terminal symbols are given below.
There is also a notion of modifiers (marked as @) that change the meaning of
terminal symbols; for example, the sign '-' means minimum of (in terms of time).
See the table of modifiers below.

> **Caution:** Threads must be pinned in order to get consistent frequency.

## Examples

Runs a set of inner products measuring performance with 6 seconds per problem
dumping results with a standard performance template:
``` sh
    ./benchdnn --ip --mode=p --max-ms-per-prb=6000 \
               --batch=inputs/ip/ip_all
```
```
Output template: perf,%engine%,%name%,%prb%,%Gops%,%Gfreq%,%-time%,%-Gflops%,%0time%,%0Gflops%
perf,cpu,"resnet:ip1",mb112oc1000ic2048n"resnet:ip1",0.458752,0,0.521729,879.293,0.576451,795.822
```

Runs a set of inner products measuring performance and dumping results in
CSV-style:
``` sh
    ./benchdnn --ip --mode=p --perf-template=csv \
               --batch=inputs/ip/ip_all
```
```
Output template: perf,%engine%,%name%,%dir%,%cfg%,%attr%,%DESC%,%Gops%,%Gfreq%,%-time%,%-Gflops%,%0time%,%0Gflops%
perf,cpu,"resnet:ip1",FWD_B,f32,,112,1000,2048,1,1,0.458752,0,0.520264,881.768,0.564043,813.328
```

Runs a set of inner products measuring performance and dumping custom template -
reporting descriptor, minimum time, and corresponding gigaFLOPs. Note: ',' is
not a special symbol here; any other delimiter can be used:
``` sh
    ./benchdnn --ip --mode=p --perf-template=%prb%,%-time%,%-Gflops% \
               --batch=inputs/ip/ip_all
```
```
Output template: %prb%,%-time%,%-Gflops%
mb112oc1000ic2048n"resnet:ip1",0.521973,878.881
```
