Primitive Attributes: Scratchpad {#dev_guide_attributes_scratchpad}
===================================================================

Some primitives might require a temporary buffer while performing their
computations. For instance, the operations that do not have enough independent
work to utilize all cores on a system might use parallelization over the
reduction axis (e.g. k-axis in matrix-matrix multiplication). In this case
the threads compute partial results in a temporary buffer and once finished
the library reduces partial results into the final one. Another example is
a convolution implementation that uses GEMM. Before using a GEMM the source
images needs to be rearranged by so-called `im2col` transformation.
The transformation happens in a temporary buffer that is then used as an
input for GEMM.

In both of these examples, the temporary buffer is no longer required
once the primitive computation is completed. DNNL refers to such a
memory buffer as a **scratchpad**.

@warning
    Do not confuse **scratchpad** with
    [Workspace](@ref dev_guide_inference_and_training_aspects_workspace).
    The workspace is a buffer that is shared between forward and backward
    propagation of a primitive (hence **must** be preserved between the calls)
    and is used only in training.

The amount of space required for the scratchpad depends on the
primitive and its actual implementation. For example, the GEMM-based
convolution requires a scratchpad for the `im2col` data, while the
direct convolution does not.

Both types of implementation might need extra space for the reduction in case
there are too few independent tasks. The `im2col` size is proportional to the
size of the source image multiplied by the weights spatial size. The size of a
buffer for reduction is proportional to the tensor size to be reduced (e.g.,
`diff_weights` in the case of backward by weights) multiplied by the number of
threads in the reduction groups (the upper bound is the overall number of
threads).

By contrast, some other primitives might require very little extra space. For
instance, one of the implementation of the @ref dnnl::sum primitive requires
temporary space only to store the pointers to data for each and every input
array (that is, the size of the scratchpad is `n * sizeof(void *)`, where `n` is
the number of summands).

DNNL supports two modes for handling scratchpads:
1. #dnnl::scratchpad_mode::library.
   The library allocates memory for each primitive during its creation. This
   is the **default** behavior which enables user to not worry about the
   scratchpad at all.
   The scratchpad management policy can be configured at compile-time
   using the DNNL_ENABLE_CONCURRENT_EXEC (@ref dev_guide_build_options)
   cmake option.
   - When DNNL_ENABLE_CONCURRENT_EXEC=OFF (**default**), a global scratchpad
      memory is  shared across primitives. This mode minimizes the
      amount of memory needed for scratchpads at the application level. The global
      scratchpad is freed when all the primitives referencing it are destroyed.
      @warning
      In this mode, primitives can be created and executed in parallel but must
      be executed in the same thread they were created in. Executing primitives
      in a different thread than the one they were created in will result in
      segmentation fault. If you might execute a primitive in a thread
      different than the one it was created in, consider using
      #dnnl::scratchpad_mode::user or DNNL_ENABLE_CONCURRENT_EXEC=ON.
   - When DNNL_ENABLE_CONCURRENT_EXEC=ON, each primitive allocates its own
      private scratchpad memory. The scratchpad memory is freed when its
      primitive is destroyed. This mode can lead to larger memory footprint when
      compared to DNNL_ENABLE_CONCURRENT_EXEC=OFF.
      @warning
      In this mode, primitives can be created in one thread and executed in
      another. Also, different primitives can be run concurrently.
      If the same primitive is run from two different threads concurrently,
      the library will return incorrect results.
      If you might run the same primitive in two threads concurrently, consider
      using #dnnl::scratchpad_mode::user or DNNL_ENABLE_CONCURRENT_EXEC=OFF.
2. #dnnl::scratchpad_mode::user.
   A user provides scratchpad memory that has sufficient space at primitive
   execution (using the `DNNL_ARG_SCRATCHPAD` tag). This enables the user to
   reuse the memory as well as to make the primitives thread-safe. However, this
   requires a good memory manager (in terms of speed and locality) on the user's
   side.

@warning
   Primitives are not thread-safe by default. The only way to make the
   primitive execution fully thread-safe is to use the
   #dnnl::scratchpad_mode::user mode and not pass the same scratchpad memory to
   two primitives that are executed concurrently.

The scratchpad mode is controlled though the
@ref dnnl_primitive_attr_set_scratchpad_mode (C API) and
@ref dnnl::primitive_attr::set_scratchpad_mode (C++ API) primitive attributes,
and should be passed during the primitive descriptor creation
(@ref dev_guide_attributes).

It is worth mentioning that all primitives support both scratchpad modes.
That is, primitive descriptor creation success or failure cannot depend on the
scratchpad mode used.

## Scratchpad Memory Engine

If the user provides scratchpad memory to a primitive, this memory must be
created using the same engine that the primitive uses.

## Examples

#### Library Manages Scratchpad

As mentioned above, this is a default behavior. We only want to highlight how a
user can query the amount of memory consumed by a primitive due to a scratchpad.

~~~cpp
// Use default attr, hence the library allocates scratchpad
dnnl::primitive::primitive_desc op_pd(params, ...);

// Print how much memory would be hold by a primitive due to scratchpad
std::cout << "primitive will use "
          << op_pd.query_s64(dnnl::query::memory_consumption_s64)
          << " bytes" << std::endl;

// In this case scratchpad is internal, hence user visible scratchpad memory
// descriptor should be empty:
auto zero_md = dnnl::memory::desc();
assert(op_pd.scratchpad_desc() == zero_md);
~~~

#### User Manages Scratchpad

~~~cpp
// Create an empty (default) attributes
dnnl::primitive_attr attr;

// Default scratchpad mode is `library`:
assert(attr.get_scratchpad_mode() == dnnl::scratchpad_mode::library);

// Set scratchpad mode to `user`
attr.set_scratchpad_mode(dnnl::scratchpad_mode::user);

// Create a primitive descriptor with custom attributes
dnnl::primitive::primitive_desc op_pd(op_d, attr, engine);

// Query the scratchpad memory descriptor
dnnl::memory::desc scratchpad_md = op_pd.scratchpad_desc();

// Note, that a primitive doesn't consume memory in this configuration:
assert(op_pd.query_s64(dnnl::query::memory_consumption_s64) == 0);

// Create a primitive
dnnl::primitive prim(op_pd);

// ...

// Create a scratchpad memory
// NOTE: if scratchpad is not required for a particular primitive the
//       scratchpad_md.get_size() will return 0. It is fine to have
//       scratchpad_ptr == nullptr in this case.
void *scratchpad_ptr = user_memory_manager::allocate(scratchpad_md.get_size());
// NOTE: engine here must much the engine of the primitive
dnnl::memory scratchpad(scratchpad_md, engine, scratchpad_ptr);

// Pass a scratchpad memory to a primitive
prim.execute(stream, {
        ...,
        {DNNL_ARG_SCRATCHPAD, scratchpad}});
~~~
