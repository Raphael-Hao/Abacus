    /// corresponding device. In particular, that means neither memory objects
    /// nor primitives that were created for one engine can be used on
    /// another.
    ///
    /// To create engines, we must specify the @ref dnnl::engine::kind
    /// and the index of the device of the given kind. There is only one CPU
    /// engine and one GPU engine, so the index for both engines must be 0.

    /// more general @ref dev_guide_eltwise primitive, which applies a specified
    /// function to each element of the source tensor.
    ///
    /// Just as in the case of @ref dnnl::memory, a user should always go
    /// through (at least) three creation steps (which, however, can sometimes
    /// be combined thanks to C++11):
    /// 1. Initialize an operation descriptor (in the case of this example,
    ///    @ref dnnl::eltwise_forward::desc), which defines the operation
    ///    parameters including a GPU memory descriptor.
    /// 2. Create an operation primitive descriptor (here @ref
    ///    dnnl::eltwise_forward::primitive_desc) on a GPU engine, which is a
    ///    **lightweight** descriptor of the actual algorithm that
    ///    **implements** the given operation.
    /// 3. Create a primitive (here @ref dnnl::eltwise_forward) that can be
    ///    executed on GPU memory objects to compute the operation by a GPU
    ///    engine.
    ///
    ///@note
    ///    Primitive creation might be a very expensive operation, so consider
    ///    creating primitive objects once and executing them multiple times.
    ///
    /// The code:
    /// @snippet cross_engine_reorder.cpp Create a ReLU primitive
    // [Create a ReLU primitive]
    //  ReLU op descriptor (uses a GPU memory as source memory.
    //  no engine- or implementation-specific information)

    /// Reorder(CPU,GPU) -> ReLU -> Reorder(GPU,CPU).
    ///
    /// 1. After execution of the first Reorder, ReLU has source data in GPU.
    ///
    /// 2. The input and output memory objects are passed to the ReLU
    /// `execute()` method using a <tag, memory> map. Each tag specifies what
    /// kind of tensor each memory object represents. All @ref dev_guide_eltwise
    /// primitives require the map to have two elements: a source memory
    /// object (input) and a destination memory (output). For executing
    /// on GPU engine, both source and destination memory object must use
    /// GPU memory.
    ///
    /// 3. After the execution of the ReLU on GPU, the second Reorder moves
    /// the results from GPU to CPU.
    ///
    /// @note
    ///    All primitives are executed in the SAME GPU stream (the first
    ///    parameter of the `execute()` method).
    ///
    /// Execution is asynchronous on GPU. This means that we need to call @ref
    /// dnnl::stream::wait before accessing the results.
    ///
